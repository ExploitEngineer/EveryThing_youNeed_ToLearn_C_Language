## üöÄ How to Get Started

Here‚Äôs how you can start learning and coding in C with this repository:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ExploitEngineer/EveryThing_youNeed_ToLearn_C_Language.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd EveryThing_youNeed_ToLearn_C_Language
```

### 2. **Explore the Repository**

Browse the organized structure and dive into topics:

```bash
# Example: Open the "Code Examples" folder
cd Code_Examples
ls
```

### 3. **Run Code Examples**

Compile and run any example program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

```bash
# Compile the C program
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run the executable
./output
```

### 4. **Automate Compilation (Optional)**

To streamline the compilation and execution process, we‚Äôve included a simple Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# compile_and_run.sh: Compile and run a C program

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./compile_and_run.sh <filename.c>"
    exit 1
fi

FILENAME=$1
EXECUTABLE="output"

# Compile the program
if gcc $FILENAME -o $EXECUTABLE; then
    echo "Compilation successful! Running the program..."
    ./$EXECUTABLE
else
    echo "Compilation failed. Please check your code."
fi
```

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./compile_and_run.sh filename.c
```
